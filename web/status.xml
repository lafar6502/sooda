    <h1>Current Status</h1>
    <p>
        Sooda has been successfully used in production systems since 2003 and the core of the system is very stable.
        The command line tools that accompany it are mostly mature, but some newer utilities (such as Sooda Configuration Wizard) 
        may still need work before they can be declared production quality code.

        Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005 are the most tested RDBMs. Other databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) are known to
        work with Sooda, but since they are not primary development environments, you may run into some bugs. Contributors 
        that would like to maintain support for these databases are welcome to <link href="mailinglist">join the project</link>.
