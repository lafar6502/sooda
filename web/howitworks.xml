    <h1>How Sooda works?</h1>
    <p>
        Sooda is an O/R mapper which is based on code generation. You provide 
        it with a simple XML file which describes the mapping between .NET classes
        and database tables and Sooda generates the appropriate classes for you.
        The generated classes implement the required persistence functionality and expose
        a strongly-typed API which you can use to create, load, save, delete and query 
        your objects.
