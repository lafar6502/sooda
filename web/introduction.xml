        <b>Sooda</b> is an object-to-relational mapping (O/R Mapping) software for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net">.NET</a> environment.
        It lets you automatically generate an object-oriented data access layer (DAL) for your application.
        Instead of writing SQL code, you can now focus on writing business rules in object-oriented .NET languages.
